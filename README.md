# Introduction

The real-world data analysis repository consists of subprojects that helps in cleaning, preparing and analysis sample data from digital healthcare apps or electronic medical records.
R version 4.3.1 was used for analysis.

# Subproject 1
## Digital healthcare data
Currently, this project cleans and visualizes dummy patient-reported data (PRD). It uses basic R functions to clean and prepare data. ggplot2 is used to visualize data. The main goal of this script is to study the effectiveness of a mental health app using PRD. 

Features:
- dealing with missing data
- sample size estimation (in progress- to be added)
- statistical analysis
- data visualization


### Input data:
The R script will run without problems if the sample csv (dummy_patient_reported_data.csv) is in the working directory.
